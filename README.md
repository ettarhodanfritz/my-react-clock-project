# React Live Clock

A simple React app that displays the current time and updates every second using React hooks.

## How It Works

- Uses `useState` to store the current time  
- Uses `useEffect` with `setInterval` to update the time every second  
- Renders the time inside a header element

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to see the live clock in action.
